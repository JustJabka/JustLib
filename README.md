# About

This library has a modular structure that separates the API and internal components. This makes it easy to maintain the library and import only the necessary modules into projects, which allows to reduce the file size and decreases the load on the server.

You can check out the [wiki](https://github.com/JustJabka/JustLib/wiki/About%E2%9D%93) if you want to learn more about this library🎓

## Why make another library?

I decided to write this library because I was tired of writing the same thing over and over again in my datapacks.
Why not just use existing libraries? In my opinion, they are bad. Some of them are too complicated, some are prematurely optimized, and some are just bad🥀
I wanted to find a middle ground between optimization, develop time, and simplicity of use. So I created another library, yeah😓
